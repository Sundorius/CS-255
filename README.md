These are some of the assignments of class CS-255 from the University of Crete Department of Computer Science, that were completed by me from start to finish.

The "Translate Program" is a translation program that translates from iso8859-7 to iso8859-1.

In "A String Module", I implemented the most used string function of C language in two different ways.
The first implementation contains definitions of these functions using arrays and the second implementation using pointers.

In "Abstract Data Types" I implemented an abstract data type called 'Symbol Table', in two different ways.
The first implementation using a linked list and the second one using a hash table.

In "Buffer Overrun Attack":
	1) with createdata3.c the hello program must crash.
	2) with createdata6.c the hello program must print my name and recommend that I get a grade 6.
